              <h2>Background information</h2>
              <p>I began my undergraduate education studying biology. After I graduated, I used that degree to become a secondary school Biology teacher in a rural Tanzanian village teaching in both Swahili and English for <span class="emphasize">two years</span>. I was doing a lot of HIV and malaria education during my time as a teacher and really enjoyed it! Therefore I decided to continue my education by going to graduate school for public health at The Arctic University of Norway, which is the worlds most northern university! This degree led me to a job in behavioral health where I worked for the SouthEast Alaska Regional Health Consortium as their wilderness guide! I had the opportunity to work with teens struggling with substance abuse and take them on backpacking and kayaking trips. While I thoroughly enjoyed this job, I felt like there was so much more out there and when I discovered there was an opportunity to learn to code and be qualified for a new job in just a few short months I knew it was something I had to do! </p>
